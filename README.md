# Predicting-Customer-Conversion-through-ML-&-DL-models
Applying Supervised and Unsupervised models to predict visitor to customer conversion for an online store

In this project, I have tested multiple algorithms to predict the probability of a visitor to an online store making a purchase (i.e. generating revenue). 

The following files are available in this directory:

1. Code.py: This is the Python file that contains the code that I developed for this project

2. Dataset Description.pdf: This is a pdf document in which I have described the attributes of the dataset. 

4. input_training_data.csv: This file contains the training data in csv form

5. input_training_data.csv: This file contains the test data in csv form
